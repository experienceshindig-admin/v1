# Welcome Shindig Developers

This repository has a .gitignore which only tracks custom development. 

You may specify a child theme or custom plugin at the end of that file
if you would like to see it tracked here. 

This git repo will function as the single source of truth and will be
used to overwrite any files on the live and staging servers. 

## Dependencies
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

We use EditorConfig to "maintain consistent coding styles for multiple
developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs". 

Some editors integrate this by default, most will need a plugin. These are
detailed on the EditorConfig [download page](https://editorconfig.org/#download) 

## Getting started

You will need the following: 

1. A WordPress development server set up locally
2. All the current plugins and mu-plugins from the server
3. A copy of the database, with URLs modified for your local

## Contributing
 1. Create a branch
 2. Make distinct commits for each complete change
 3. Push code, start a Pull Request or merge to master
 4. If you have access you can then make your changes live via FTP

You can read about this on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
documentation. Note side arrows to progress through those docs.
